# Notes

The game doesn't end once someone reaches 0 health; If you want to reset the scores, refresh the page

When the ghost opponent guesses and the timer expires, your guess will not auto-lock; you need to manually place the guess

# Maps

Currently, there is only one map, but I'll add more maps based on elo ranges and gamemode in the future

## Coverage

### Duel guesses

All Duel games, besides ones placed in "The World" or "World", are tracked

### Classic game guesses

Only maps that are either verified by GeoGuessr, made by certain map creators, or is personally added to the database by me are allowed to show up. Note that some maps are banned (ex. Maps by GeoGuessr, maps that have a lot of unofficial coverage, etc.)

# Contribute guesses

All past guesses are collected from the "Friend Activity" page in GeoGuessr who have "Share my activity with friends" turned on

## Database

Past ghost data is gathered through downloading a CSV file.

The CSV file is just multiple lines only uses first cell, and is in this format:

`<MapId> <LinkToCSVFileForMap>`

It'll then grab that map's CSV file, which is also just multiple lines only using the first cell in this format:

`<PanoId>/<GameType>/<GameMode>/<GameId>/<RoundNumber>`

# Plans

- Offer maps based on elo range, gamemode, and if it's rural/urban
- Keybinding to reset score
- Option to automatically have health reset after someone reaches 0 HP

# Known bugs

# ðŸ’– Thanks

i'm someone who isn't too experienced with JS / web development, so thanks to these people for making life easier:

- [miraclewhips](https://miraclewhips.dev) for [geoguessr-event-framework](https://github.com/miraclewhips/geoguessr-event-framework), [World Score Reference](https://miraclewhips.dev/#world-score-reference), and a lot of open source scripts I could look at and learn/take from
- tyow for [Guess retriever](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/482055-guess-retriever) (using a modified version for the database)
- [LearnableMeta](https://learnablemeta.com/) for it initially being used to display only scores (and got me to start playing GeoGuessr)

and everyone who added me on GeoGuessr for helping with this project
